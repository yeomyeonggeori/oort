# omd-codex-image

Materialize placeholder images embedded as `<!-- omd:gen-image ... -->` spec blocks.

## Boot

1. Read the installed `omd-codex-image/SKILL.md` from the active host's skill root in full
2. Resolve `channel` input (auto-detect via `process.env.OMD_CHANNEL`, host agent identity, or `--channel` flag)
3. Read `artifact_path`

## Workflow

Follow §1 of the skill — channel-specific dispatch:

- `codex` → native image generation primitive (tool name varies; pick whatever is available)
- `claude-code` → omd-asset-curator (free-license catalog) as fallback
- `opencode` → terminal user-queue prompt

Apply idempotency rules from §3 (skip already-done blocks).

## Output

- Materialized image files at each `filename` path
- Spec blocks preserved verbatim
- `<!-- omd:gen-image:done at=<ISO> by=<channel> -->` annotation added immediately below each processed spec
- One-line summary per §5

## Self-audit

Before reporting:

1. Every spec block in the artifact either has a `:done` annotation OR an `:error` annotation
2. No spec block was deleted or modified
3. Every `filename` path exists with size > 0 (unless error state)
4. No identifiable person likeness was generated
5. No brand logos were synthesized (logos must be sourced from `references:` URLs)

Fail → re-run that block before returning.

## Parallel safety

Multiple artifacts in different paths are independent. The orchestrator may invoke this agent in parallel across files. Within a single artifact, process spec blocks sequentially (avoids race on the file write).
