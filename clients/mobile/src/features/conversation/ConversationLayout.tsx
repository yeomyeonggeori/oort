// =============================================================================
// Timeline above, composer below, and the composer stays visible when the
// keyboard is up. This is the RN answer to the problem the web client solved
// with `visualViewport` (goal B9).
//
// ## Why this is a component and not six lines inside `ConversationScreen`
//
// Because it is the thing being measured. The requirement is a claim about
// pixels ("컴포저가 키보드에 가리지 않을 것"), and while this composition lived
// inline in the screen the harness could not reach it without also standing up
// a session, a query client and a realtime rail — so it measured `Timeline` and
// `Composer` side by side in a plain View instead, which is a DIFFERENT layout.
// Naming the composition means `measure/` renders the tree that ships.
//
// ## `KeyboardAvoidingView` was tried first, and measured wrong
//
// `behavior="padding"` computes its inset as `frame.y + frame.height -
// keyboardFrame.screenY`, where `frame` comes from its own `onLayout` — which
// is in PARENT coordinates, while `screenY` is in screen coordinates. The two
// only agree when the view is the root. This layout never is: in the app it
// sits under a safe-area inset and a header, in the harness under a results
// panel. Measured in the harness, `KeyboardAvoidingView` produced 75px of a
// needed 335px and left the composer 260px behind the keyboard; in the app the
// same error is smaller and nastier, short by exactly the top safe-area inset
// (~59pt), which looks like a design choice rather than a bug.
//
// `keyboardVerticalOffset` exists to correct precisely this, but the value that
// corrects it is "how far this view's coordinate origin is from the top of the
// screen" — a different number at every mount point, which the component cannot
// know and the caller should not have to.
//
// What is true by construction is simpler: **this view's bottom edge is the
// screen's bottom edge**, in both places it is mounted. So the inset it needs is
// exactly the keyboard's height, which the OS reports directly. No coordinate
// spaces to reconcile, and one number that the harness reads back to check.
//
// The safe-area inset is paid ONLY while the keyboard is down. A raised keyboard
// already covers the home indicator, so paying both leaves a dead band between
// the input and the keys; with the keyboard down, that inset is what keeps the
// send button out of the system's gesture area.
